## DeepLearning
# My deep learning projects#
1. Custom object detection using Yolov3. Here custom object used was done whichis not present in the coco dataset.
2. Create a dataset fpr Monocular Depth Estimation. The files  used to create the dataset were 100 foregrounds and 100 backgrounds.
Foregrounds were superimposed on back grounds and 400k images were created for dataset. Also the dataset contained masks of the foregorunds and the depth maps for the images from the datasets.
3. Prediction of masks and depth maps for the give foreground and background created using the above dataset from 2.
4. Training Resnet18 from scratch using TinyImagenet dataset.
